- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Custom SVG backgrounds
- Web-safe fonts (Montserrat & Quicksand)

## 📋 Usage Guide

### Encoding Text:

1. Select the "Encode" tab
2. Choose your desired encoding method from the dropdown
3. For Caesar Cipher, select a shift value (default is the traditional 3)
4. Type or paste your text in the input area
5. Click "Encode" to see the result
6. Use the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the encoded text
7. Alternatively, click "Open in New Tab" to view the result in a separate tab

### Decoding Text:

1. Select the "Decode" tab
2. Choose the appropriate decoding method (must match the encoding method used)
3. For Caesar Cipher, select the same shift value that was used for encoding
4. Paste the encoded text in the input area
5. Click "Decode" to see the result
6. Use the provided buttons to copy or open the result in a new tab

## 🔍 Supported Encoding Methods

### Base64

Standard Base64 encoding and decoding for text data.

### Caesar Cipher

The classic substitution cipher where each letter is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. Options include:
- Shift 1: A→B, B→C, etc.
- Shift 3: Traditional Caesar cipher (A→D, B→E, etc.)
- Shift 13: ROT13 (A→N, B→O, etc.)
- And more options...

### Reverse Text

Simple text reversal where "Hello" becomes "olleH".

### Binary Conversion

Converts text to binary representation and vice versa:
- Text to Binary: Each character is converted to its 8-bit binary ASCII/Unicode value
- Binary to Text: Binary values are converted back to characters

### Morse Code

Translates text to Morse code dots and dashes and vice versa.
